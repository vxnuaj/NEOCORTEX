Bootstrapped samples are a set of samples $\hat{X}$ that are drawn from an overarching set of samples $X$ through a uniform distribution.

$\hat{X}$ has samples of $X$ but may miss some samples of $X$ and instead repeat some samples of $X$ multiple times.

This is called sampling with replacement.

The total size of $\hat{X}$ is the same size as $X$.
