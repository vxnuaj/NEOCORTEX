Principal Component Analysis is the means for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset, say ${x_k}, k \in [1, ..., N]$ with dimensionality $D$ to dimensionality $M$ where $M < D$.

Essentially, it answers, *"How do we reduce the dimensionality of a set of samples?"*.

It aims to maximize the preservation of the original variation of $x_k$ with dimensionality $D$, while compressing $x_k$ down to dimensionality $M$, again where $M < D$.

Principal Component Analysis is useful for:
1. Dimensionality Reduction
2. Data Visualization
3. Feature Extraction
