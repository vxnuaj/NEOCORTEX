A type of train and test split that yields the same % of classes in the trainign set to the same % of classes in the test set.

This allows for the model evaluation to ensure that a model can reliably predict all classes, rather than having a test dataset, be biased towards a specific class during testing.

This is particularly important in unbalanced datasets.
