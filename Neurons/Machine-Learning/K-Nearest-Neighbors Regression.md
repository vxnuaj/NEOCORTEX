An instance of *K-Nearest-Neighbors,* where we compute a regression rather than a classification.

In K-nearest-neighbors regression, you take a dataset $Y$ and then choose an arbitrary $X$. 

For that $X$ we take the average $Y$ of the $K$ values which will be the $Y$ that corresponds to $X$.

This is then for all $X$ until we get a regression line.
