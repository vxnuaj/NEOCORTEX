These, unlike [[Parametric Methods]], don't make explicit assumptions about the form of $f$. 

By doing so, they can have the advantage to fit a wider range of possible shapes of $f$, avoiding the danger of not being able to estimate the true $f$ from it's functional basis provided through a [[parametric method]].
