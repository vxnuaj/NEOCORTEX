Saliency maps aim to visualize the areas of an input image that are most influential for the output of a neural network.

They are generated by taking the gradients of a neural network with respect to the features of the input sample. It serves as a metric for how much the activations of a neural network will change as the inputs change.

The higher the gradient at a given location on the saliency map, the more pronounced the area on the saliency map will be.
