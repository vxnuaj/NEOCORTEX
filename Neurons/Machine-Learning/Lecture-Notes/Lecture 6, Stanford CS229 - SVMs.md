### **Functional Margin**

If given a model of [[logistic regression]], the task is to predict $1$ if the true label $Y$ is $1$. 

Thereby, if we're given an input $X$, with a true class label of $1$, we hope that the output prediction $\hat{Y}$ is $>> .5$, not merely $> .5$.

This is as we want the model to ideally be as confident as possible, not at the edge of choosing $0$ over $1$.
