When based on the [[information gain]] and the [[weighted entropy]] / [[Entropy]] on a binary decision tree.

1. Compute baseline [[entropy]] for both splits 
2. Compute the [[weighted entropy]] for the given splits 
3. Compute the [[Information Gain]] for the given splits 
4. Do this for all splits 
5. Choose the best split, that maximizes information gain or minimizes weighted entropy
