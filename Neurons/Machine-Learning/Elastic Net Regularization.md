Elastic net is a combination of [[L1 Regularization]] and [[L2 Regularization]], where after computing the [[L1 Regularization]] and [[L2 Regularization]] penalties, they're multiplied by factors of $\alpha$ and $(1 - \alpha)$ respectively and then added together.

When $\alpha$ is 1, the $L2$ penalty is none while is $\alpha$ is $0$, the $L1$ penalty is $0$.

> *Or inverted depending on how one implements it*

Thereby elastic net finds a means to combine [[L1 Regularization]] and [[L2 Regularization]].
