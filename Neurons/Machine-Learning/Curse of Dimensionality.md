As the dimensionality (the number of variables of a space) grows, distance and density become difficult to interpret.

As the dimensionality grows, the volume of a given space, $\mathbb{R}^n$, grows exponentially.

Thereby, the distance between each datapoint $i$, tends to grow exponentially as $\mathbb{R}^n$ grows exponentially.

To fulfill the space $n$, proportionally to say an original 1D space, you'd need $i^n$ datapoints.

For example, if we had a set of data points $i$ in a $1$-dimensional space, and we moved to a $3$-dimensional space, we'd need $i^3$ datapoints to fill-up the $\mathbb{R}^3$ space equivalently.

Otherwise, the space becomes sparse.
