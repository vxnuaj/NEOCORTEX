Support vectors are the margins or 'padding' that surround the linear classifier of a [[Support Vector Machine]]. 

They can be defined as the closest points to the hyperplane defined by a [[Support Vector Machine]], they can either violate or lie on the margin, as they are the ones that directly affect the design of the [[Support Vector Machine]].
