The sigmoid function is an [[activation function]] commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity, defined as:

$Ïƒ(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

The function is shaped as an S-shaped curve, in the range of $0 < \hat{y} < 1$, one of it's use cases being to compute an output as a probability.

It's most commonly used in the output layer binary classification models or [[logistic regression]].
