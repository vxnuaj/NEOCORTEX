A TPU is an AI accelerator [[ASIC]] designed by Google for accelerating the training of their deep learning architectures using their proprietary [[Tensorflow]] software.

TPUs train models more efficiently as they use hardware that's specifically designed for performing large matrix operations found in deep learning algorithms.

##### How they work:

A [[CPU]] is based on the [[von Neumann architecture]],
