The loss function of a neural network is a metric that determines error between a prediction and a true output value.

Whilst training a neural network, the value of the loss function is aimed to be minimized to maximize the accuracy of a model.

This loss value is of important use during [[gradient descent]] as the [[Update rule]] is based on taking the gradient of the loss with respect to a specific parameter.

##### Types of Loss Functions:
- [[Sigmoid]]
- [[ReLU]]
- [[Leaky ReLU]]
- [[Tanh]]
