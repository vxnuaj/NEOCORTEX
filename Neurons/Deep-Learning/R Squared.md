Also known as the coefficient of determination, $R^2$ explains the total variance in a dependent variable $Y$, yielded by the independent variables $\theta$, used to predict the dependent $Y$.

$1 - \frac{SSE}{TSS}$

If $R^2$ is $.85$, that indicates that 85% of the variation in $Y$ can be explained by $\theta_i$, where $i ~ ‚Ñù^2$
