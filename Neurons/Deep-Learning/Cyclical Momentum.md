Cyclical momentum is a means of cycling the momentum hyperparameter during training a model in accordance with cycles used during a [[Cyclical Learning Rate]].

Typically, the larger the learning rate gets, the more the momentum should decrease in accordance to it to maintain stability in the learning process.
