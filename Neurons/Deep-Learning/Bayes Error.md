Bayes error is the lowest possible prediction error that can be achieved within a model.

There will always be a certain, even if small, amount of error in a model despite it knowing the probability distribution that generates the data, if the process that generates.

This is as there's always a small amount of noise or randomness within a probability distribution that makes it difficult to
