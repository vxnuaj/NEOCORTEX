Nesterov momentum is a variant of [[Momentum]], which serves a similar, yet upgraded means to compute the optima of the loss in a faster and more direct manner when compared to [[Momentum]].

You, in a sense, allow for the [[Gradient Descent]] to 'look ahead' and predict what the optimal next jump would be. This is done through a 'lookahead'
