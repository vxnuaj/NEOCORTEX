#LinearAlgebra 

For a matrix to be in Row Echelon Form:

1. If a given row isn't all $0$s, then the first non-zero number must be a $1$
2. All zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix
3. In set of two successive rows that aren't of all zeros, the first non-zero number $1$ in the second row then occurs further right of the leading $1$ in the previous row.
