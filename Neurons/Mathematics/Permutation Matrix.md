A permutation matrix is a binary matrix that holds exactly a single $1$ in each column or row while the rest of the components of the given column or row are $0$.

$P = \begin{bmatrix} 0, 0, 1 \\ 0, 1, 0 \\ 1, 0, 0 \end{bmatrix}$

They serve as a means to reorder the rows or columns of a matrix, when multiplied by it. If we have a permutation matrix $P$, a permutation of $A$ by $P$ is then:

$PA = \hat{A}$

Each permutation matrix is [[orthogonal]], it's inverse being equal to it's transpose as $P^{-1} = P^T$
