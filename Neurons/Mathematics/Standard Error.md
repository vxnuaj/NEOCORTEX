The standard error is the standard deviation of a sample population, estimating how well the sample population maps to the full population.

$SE(\mu) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a population and $n$ are the total samples of the population.

As $n$ increases, the $SE(\mu)$ will shrink.
