#LinearAlgebra 

A singular vector or matrix is a square matrix where it has a [[determinant]] of $0$.

If the [[determinant]] is non-zero, then it is non-singular, thereby having no-inverse.

A singular matrix, in the context of a system of linear equations, doesn't have a unique solution $x$ for a given vector $b$. It instead can have infinitely many $x$ or none at all.
