The Frobenius Norm is defined very similarly to the [[Euclidean Norm]], but is instead utilized for matrices rather than pure vectors.

It's defined as $||X|| = \sqrt{\sum_{ij} x_{ij}^2} = \sqrt{x_{11}^2 + x_{12}^2 + ... x_{ij}^2 }$ , where instead of summing over singular scalars within a column or row vector, se sum over all columns and rows of a given matrix.
