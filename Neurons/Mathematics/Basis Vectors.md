#LinearAlgebra 

A set of basis vectors are the linearly independent vectors that span a vector space $V$. Any vector in $col(V)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

>*Note that for a given space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there can be multiple sets of basis vectors.

>The only criteria is that they are linearly independent and of course, span the same $nth$ dimensional space.*


If I had a linear combination of $Ax$ where $A$ is $(m, n)$ the set of basis vectors would be the individual columns vectors of $A$ which can be used to output any $b$ within $\mathbb{R}^m$ 

Then, within a system of linear equations, a set of basis vectors are the vectors that yield any output $b$ for a unique $x$ within $Col(A)$ or $\mathbb{R}^m$. 

The columns of $A$ are the basis vectors of $Col(A)$. 

$\begin{pmatrix} 2, 1, 3, 0 \\ 3, 4, 7, 0 \\ 1, 2, 3, -1 \end{pmatrix}$
