#LinearAlgebra 

A set of basis vectors are the linearly independent vectors that span a vector space $V$. Any vector in $V$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

If I had a linear combination of $Ax$ where $A$ is $(m, n)$ the set of basis vectors would be the individual columns vectors of $A$ which can be used to output any $b$ within $\mathbb{R}^m$ 

Then, within a system of linear equations, a set of basis vectors are the vectors that yield any output $b$ for a unique $x$ within $Col(A)$ or $\mathbb{R}^m$. 

The colums of $A$ are the basis vectors of $Col(A)$.
