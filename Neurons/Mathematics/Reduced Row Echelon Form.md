For a matrix to be in reduced echelon form, it must have the properties defined by the [[Row Echelon Form]] with the addition that any column which contains it's first non-zero number to be a leading $1$ has a a set of $0$s in it's other entries.

In essence, the column of each first non-zero entry must have all $0$s. 

> *While in [[Row Echelon Form]], the $0$s must only be below.*

$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$

Reduced Row Echelon Form can be attained via [[Gaussian Elimination]].

Any matrix in Reduced Row Echelon Form is in [[Row Echelon Form]]

Through Reduced Row Echelon Form, we're able to find the basis vectors of the row space of a matrix.
