#LinearAlgebra 

To solve a system of linear equations, $Ax = B$, you:

1. Take the [[row echelon form]] of $A$.
2. Transform the [[Row Echelon Form]] of $A$ into a system of linear equations via [[Gaussian Elimination]]
3. Solve the [[Systems of Linear Equations]] via [[Backsubstitution]]

> *Note that you don't have to compute the full process of [[Gaussian Elimination]] prior to solving the system of equations. You can identify when you have enough information to solve the system, and solve it directly then.*
