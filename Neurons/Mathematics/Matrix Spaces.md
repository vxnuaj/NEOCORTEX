The dimension of a matrix space is given by the number of unique / independent components in the given matrix.

For example, in a $3 \times 3$ matrix $M$, the dimension is $9$.

But if $M$ is symmetric, it's only independent components are the $3$ in the diagonal, and the $3$ off diagonal values.

Despite there being $6$ off diagonal elements, only $3$ values are independent, as $1$ of them determines the other.

So the dimension of the matrix space, $M$, is $6$ rather than $9$.
