In a $p$ dimensional space, a hyperplane is a flat subspace of dimension $p-1$.

In $2$ dimensions, a hyperplane is just a line.
In $3$ dimensions, a hyperplane is a flat $2$-dimensional plane.
In $4$ dimensions, a hyperplane is a $3$ dimensional space within the $\in \mathbb{R}^3$ that corresponds to $\mathbb{R}^4$.

A hyperplane can be simply defined as an [[affine transformation]], as:

$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n$
