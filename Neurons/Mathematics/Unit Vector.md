A unit vector is a vector with a $||v|| = 1$.

Given a vector $\vec{u}$, we can find the unit vector by taking $\vec{u}$ and dividing it by $||u||$. 

$unit(\vec{u}) = \frac{\vec{u}}{||\vec{u}||}$

Taking the magnitude of this result would then yield us $1$, hence the unit vector.

Note that the [[dot product]] of two unit vectors, say unit vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{U}$ is:

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{U} = cos \theta$

where then we can find $\theta$ to get the angle between 2 vectors.
