Orthogonality denotes the trait that two vectors or matrices are perpendicular to each other.

A vector, $w$, is orthogonal to another vector, $v$, if the [[dot product]] of the two vectors equals the zero vector.

A matrix, $A$, is orthogonal to another matrix, $B$, if $A^TB = I$, where $I$ is the [[Identity Matrix]].
