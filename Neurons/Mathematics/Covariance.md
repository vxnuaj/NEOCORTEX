Covariance measures how much 2 variables change together, quantifying the degree to which changes in 1 variable, $X$, are correlated with the same changes in $Y$.

If $X$ and $Y$ are both extremely positive or extremely negative, then they have a high degree of covariance.

Otherwise, if $X$ is extremely positive and $Y$ is extremely negative, they have a very low covariance.
