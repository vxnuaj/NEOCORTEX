Rank-1 Matrices are matrices which have a $Rank()$ of 1, meaning there is only a single linearly independent vector and it spans a space of $\mathbb{R}$, or essentially a line.

In a Rank-1 matrix of shape $(m, n)$, the $Col()$ is a line in an $nth$ dimensional space while the $Row()$ is a line in an $mth$ dimensional space.
