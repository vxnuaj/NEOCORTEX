A dot product is a multiplication between two vectors, 

$\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}x_1, x_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1x_1 + a_2x_2\end{bmatrix} = C$

where each element in $A$ is multiplied by each element in $X$, element-wise, and then summed to get the result $C$.

The dot product can tell us by how does does a vector, $\vec{a}$ go in direction of $\vec{x}$. The greater positive the scalar result is, the more aligned $\vec{a}$ is with $\vec{x}$. The inverse is true for negative values.

The bounds for a dot product are the positive / negative bounds of $||\vec{a}|| ||\vec{x}||$.

The dot product then makes up a bigger [[Matrix Multiplication]].

**Other**:

- The dot product of 2 vectors is $0$ if they're [[orthogonal]] to each other.
