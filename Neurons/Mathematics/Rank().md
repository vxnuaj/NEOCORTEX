The $Rank()$ is a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or linearly independent columns it has.

The row rank and the column rank of a matrix are always equal, and a $Rank()$ is never $0$ if it isn't a zero matrix.

To find the $Rank()$ of a matrix, $A$, you can put it in [[Row Echelon Form]] through [[Gaussian Elimination]]. 

The Row Echelon or $Rank()$ then tells us the number of linearly independent rows $A$ determined by the number of non-zero rows it contains.
