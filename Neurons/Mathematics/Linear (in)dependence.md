Linear dependence is when a vector or set of vectors can be written as a linear combination of other vectors.

If we have a vector $\vec{c}$ where it is equal to the linear combination of $\vec{a} + 2\vec{b}$, $\vec{c}$ would be considered to be linearly dependent on $\vec{a} + 2\vec{b}$.

A vector is then linearly independent if it can't be expressed as a linear combination of a given set of vectors.

It is not possible for a vector to be linearly independent amongst all possible vectors in a vector space

In terms of [[Linear Combination]]s, as long as all columns $A$ are linearly independent, we can map any vector within $Col(A)$[^1] that's $\in \mathbb{R}^m$, if $A$ is dimensions $m, n$.
