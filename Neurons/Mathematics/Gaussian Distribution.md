Also known as the normal distribution, the gaussian distribution looks like a bell shaped curve.

The distribution represents a continuous probability distribution for a random variable, where the probability density function can be defined as:

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}$
