Also known as the normal distribution, the gaussian distribution looks like a bell shaped curve.

The distribution represents a continuous probability distribution for a random variable, where the probability density function can be defined as:

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}$

where $\mu$ controls the position of the curve on the $x$ axis while $\sigma$ controls the the height of the curve.

Note that $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

$\sigma^2$ is then the variance.

The sum of all possible $f(x)$ will be equivalent to $1$.
