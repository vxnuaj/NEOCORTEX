Given a function we want to maximize or minimize, Lagrange multipliers are the scalar multipliers that denote the maximum or minimum of a given function, under a specified constraint.

$L(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \lambda(g(x))$

where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange Multipliers, $f(x)$ is the original function we're trying to maximize or minimize, and $g(x)$ is our constraint.

**In Linear Algebra**

1. Take the derivative of $L(x, \lambda)$, see that you can compute the Lagrange as the maximum or minimum [[Eigenvalue]]
2. Find the [[Eigenvalue]]
3. The largest [[Eigenvalue]] is the Lagrange multiplier which corresponds to the maximum possible value of $f(x)$. The inverse is true for the minimum.
