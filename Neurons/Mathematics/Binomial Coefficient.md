Denoted as $\begin{pmatrix}n \\ k \end{pmatrix}$, represents the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements without regarding the order of selection.

$\begin{pmatrix}n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$

Examples:

$\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ would just be $1$
