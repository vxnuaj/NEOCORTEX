*Can Machines Think?*

To answer such a question, one needs a rigorous definition of the terms ***machine*** and ***think***.

But such definitions, if are based on common definition, are extremely ambiguous and if the answer is sought through a statistical poll, a reliable answer may not be found.

Instead (Alan), proposes the imitation game also known as the [[Turing Test]]

It is played with three people.

- A man
- A woman
- An interrogator

The interrogator ($C$) stays far apart, in a room in front of the other two.

The objective of the game is for the interrogator to determine who is a man ($A$) and who is a woman ($B$). 

At the beginning he knows them by $X$ and $Y$.

At the end he identifies either as man or woman.

If the interrogator ($C$) asks a question to $X$, which in this case say they are ($A$),

$A$ must respond in a way that attempts to prevent $C$ from getting the right answer.

On the other hand, $Y$ or in this instance, $B$, must attempt to help $C$ distinguish between the two.

But their 'truth' is difficult to discern for $C$ as $A$ can spit the same lies.

Both must provide their answers in a means that gives no clue to who the person is (typewriting or another intermediary person.)

Now the question lies in, ***What might happen if $A$ is replaced with a machine? Will $C$ decide as wrongly as often when the game is played as if it were only a man and a woman****

>*Here, Turing seems to imply that in the imitation game it is near impossible to differentiate from man or woman accurately and consistently with rational datapoints. It'd just be random guessing.

>For a machine to be intelligent, the imitation game must be played with a machine and have the same phenomena, the machine ($A$) being indistinguishable from $B$*

The means (question in answer with no physical presence) to distinguish machine from true intelligence clearly separates physical from intellectual activities. If it is only intelligence, then it must have no factor into physical abilities. 

Either $A$ or $B$ can boast about their intellectual activities but it wont matter if it seems to be true or not. The question and answer format disregards their importance. Only thoughts and ideas matter.
