**Neuromorphic Computing**

Computing based on chips that perform computations through circuits very similar to components of the brain, though still made of silicon, or can go all the way to deriving from first principles, other components of a given chip, that would prove to be more useful than traditional transistors -- (perhaps )




notes
- probably should look into real neuromorphic chips.
