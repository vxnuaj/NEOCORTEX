**Relationship between CNNs and the human brain**

The human brain receives light from the outside world via the retina (located at the back of the human eye, see below).

The retina is the tissue that is located at the back of the eye. It receives the light, via it's photoreceptors, either 'rods' or 'cones', which then convert the light to electrical signals, which are then processed by the bipolar cells. The bipolar cells serve as the intermediary between the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells. 

The bipolar cells then transmit the the electrical signals to the dendrites of the ganglion cells, and after the neuron receives them, the ganglion cell then delivers those signals down to the visual cortex via its axons.

prior to getting to the visual cortex, the electrical signals are sent to thalamus, a type of 'control center' for all senses experienced by a human (except smell). the neurons within it process the data before being sent to the visual cortex.

more specifically, visual information is sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to process the visual information.

the LGN processes information such as the contrast and brightness, distinguishes colors, and spatial and temporal frequencies of the electrical signals.

the LGN sends the processed electrical signals once more through sets of axon, which are contained in fibers called optic radiations. they directly connect the LGN to the visual cortex.
