Unsupervised learning, a model is given a set of datapoints, $X$, without a set of labels $Y$.

A model has the job to find a type of structure or pattern differentiates some datapoints from others by discovering hidden features or relationships in the data. It's not trying to predict a specific output or $Y$.

An example of doing so is [[K-means clustering]], which groups a set of input data points into different clusters based on their similarities.

A real world use case of unsupervised learning is Google news, where a set of news articles are clustered together on similar pages depending on their relevancy to each other.
