A type of machine learning model that learns to generate new data based on past samples.

They can learn to do so through supervised or unsupervised learning.

Some generative models are able to describe the underlying probability distribution of data, to generate new images while others are able to generate new examples without describing the distribution of data.

The SOTA generative models are able to generate distinct and unique images from samples, yet are still plausible to be identified as such samples

They can also synthesize data under a constraint that some outputs are pre-determined, known as [[Conditional generation]].

Some models ( LLMs for instance ) are able to generate data so well that they seem intelligent. Albeit, they're purely determining the next token based on the statistics of language and aren't intelligent (yet).[^1]
