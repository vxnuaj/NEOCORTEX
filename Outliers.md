An observation in data that heavily deviates from other observations.

These observations don't accurately represent the phenomenon being explained through the model, typically.

They can heavily skew the results of a model if not dealt with accordingly.

Of course, some outliers do represent valuable information and can provide insights into a set of datapoints.
